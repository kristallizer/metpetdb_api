Introduction to MetPetDB
************************

MetPetDB is a database for metamorphic petrology that is being designed and built by a global
community of metamorphic petrologists in collaboration with computer scientists at Rensselaer
Polytechnic Institute as part of the National Cyberinfrastructure Initiative and supported by the
National Science Foundation. 

The details of the project can be found `here <http://metpetdb.rpi.edu/metpetweb/#home>`_. 

This document explains the various tables and their attributes in the database schema.

The schema can be referenced `here <https://github.com/metpetdb/metpetdb/tree/master/mpdb-server/schema>`_. This may be reviesed slightly. It would be updated shortly. 

The Entity Relationship diagram can be found here (link to github after upload).
